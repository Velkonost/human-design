    <string name="compatibility_info_title_2">Dominance</string>
    <string name="compatibility_info_title_3">Suppression</string>
    <string name="compatibility_info_title_4">Cooperation</string>

    <string name="compatibility_info_desc_1">Interdependence defines the bonds in a relationship that cause emotions between you and your partner. These emotions can be both positive and negative. Emotions with a positive sign are passion, admiration for another person. With a negative sign - resentment, a desire to correct your partner. Interdependence occurs when one side of the Channel is activated in your bodygraph, and the other side is activated on your partner\'s bodygraph. The more there are such connections in the imposition of bodygraphs on each other, the more sensitive, brighter, more emotional the relationship will be.</string>
    <string name="compatibility_info_desc_2">Dominance is a kind of compatibility that shows what qualities are present only in you. This means that a certain Channel on your bodygraph is colored, and your partner has no energy in it at all. These are the characteristics that make you different from each other, this is your uniqueness, something that can really impress, amaze your partner. On the one hand, your uniqueness is a challenge for your partner, because it is difficult to accept what you do not understand at all. On the other hand, this kind of compatibility teaches patience, love, acceptance of other people as they are.</string>
    <string name="compatibility_info_desc_3">This kind of compatibility arises when one of the partners has an active Channel, and the other only has a Gate. Such a composite shows where we have to play by the partner\'s rules and forget about our desires. Often this type of communication between Channels brings resentment, misunderstanding, claims to each other into relations, it points to difficult places where a conflict can arise.</string>
    <string name="compatibility_info_desc_4">If you feel attracted to a person and are ready after a little communication to go to the ends of the earth with him/her, then there is such a type of compatibility as Cooperation. This is due to the fact that you have the same Channels activated with the person, and the same Gates are present in your both bodygraphs. With such a composite, one can observe a harmonious, stable, lasting relationship. Cooperation brings empathy and understanding into the lives of two people.</string>

    <string name="next_year_main_text">The departing year has been anything but tranquil. It has presented numerous serious challenges, often rooted in the dichotomy of \"us versus them.\" The world continued its journey through a civilizational crisis, moving towards the transition to 2027, heralding a profound planetary shift into a new cycle.\n\nEverything signals an imminent restructuring of humanity. Such transformations seldom occur without turbulence and shock, and there are ample reasons to believe that more lies ahead.\nUnderstanding these shifts is crucial. It grants you the opportunity not to become a victim of collective opinion but to rely on yourself with a complete awareness of the unfolding processes</string>
    <string name="next_year_general_overview_title">General Overview</string>
    <string name="next_year_general_overview_text">Concern about the future that can be resolved by reevaluating our actions and behavior. Both the global and individual security systems require changes. Modesty will help us not to rush, not to act recklessly, but to assess the situation, observe, and understand how to behave to successfully navigate through all challenges. All of humanity will be in a state of seeking the right behavior on the fly to quickly respond to a changing environment.\n\nAlmost everyone will encounter different levels of shocking events and states, and it is important to know that, relying on your Design, you will not only be able to overcome challenges but also find optimal solutions for personal growth. This is a year of crises, individualism, and readiness for struggle. However, even such a characterization carries many opportunities for those who do not get confused and do not succumb to mass hysteria. This year, all of us need to pay attention to ourselves and our survival strategies, and it is Human Design that can help you become aware of your true self, learn to recognize reactions in the body, and make appropriate decisions for yourself.</string>

    <string-array name="next_year_texts">
        <item>Humanity will be actively searching for new life security strategies, as well as ways to resolve the current situations. This is happening simultaneously at both the collective and individual levels. Humanity will be concerned about its future. The less awareness there is, the more emotional and blind the attempts to find solutions will be, potentially multiplying chaos. To make your path more conscious, strive to live in accordance with your Human Design and follow your Strategy. This way, you can understand your true self and discern where your life and decisions lie, and where it\'s someone else\'s choice.\n\nUnder the influence of emotions or collective panic, people can go to great lengths. While there is potential, being attentive, to find practical solutions in a changing environment and spread them around. There\'s a fundamental rule: in large crowds, the level of consciousness decreases and becomes more animalistic, whereas the level of individual consciousness is much higher.\nTherefore, vigilance and situational assessment are required from you, as well as efforts to rely on your Inner Authority to find and make the best decisions and choices.</item>
        <item>The second half of the year is a test of spiritual strength. Many will face shock in its various forms: political, economic, spiritual, psychological, and possibly even ideological. All of humanity is confronted with the need to cope with this challenge. Many individuals, driven by their ego, will behave recklessly, trying to prove to themselves and others their courage in the face of trials. These are the people who will face collapse and the greatest danger.\n\nImagine a trader who puts all their capital into a very dubious situation in the securities market.\nThis is an excellent time to, when facing the challenge, try to see opportunities in it and adapt by finding practical solutions, turning the shock into a new beginning. Challenges will certainly be present; try to approach them realistically. If you manage to cope, you will have a colossal advantage over everyone else who succumbs to the pressure of this wave. If you have been attentive in the first six months, you will surely fare better in the second half than others. And be sure to carefully study your Design, emphasizing your type and profile, to leverage your strongest innate qualities to the fullest.</item>
        <item>This will be a time of straightforwardness, calling things by their names, and removing masks.\nWe may observe a need to discuss what was previously hidden or silenced, a need to speak out, a need to express emotions. What people begin to voice may become the driving force for something new – the formulation of a new narrative. On a personal level, this might manifest as a tendency to express oneself and clarify things. On a collective level, we might encounter bold statements and movements. New prophets may emerge, or conversely, we may finally hear those whom we ignored before but are now ready to listen to. This style of expression can significantly propel humanity towards change.\n\nSomeone\'s expressed thought can become both a new form of organizing our lives and a call for even more upheavals, depending on who is expressing it. It is evident that there will be constructive and destructive voices. Both will become louder and more straightforward. Learning to distinguish them and listen to the ones right for you will help understand your personal Human Design, facilitating making the right decisions and achieving any goal exclusively through comfortable paths.</item>
        <item>Humanity will be discussing struggle and resistance. Regardless of your location, language, or culture, there will be a conversation about the values worth fighting for. The same might happen on a personal level – where is the line beyond which one cannot stand aside? The internal pressure to fight will be directed toward exploring life-generating meanings and values and understanding the nature of the struggle itself: what it is, how it is, and for what purpose. On the collective human level, there will be a discourse on the resistance of values.\n\nOn a personal level, the first thing you need to do is understand your own nature, comprehend and study your personal Human Design to gain comprehensive and exhaustive answers to the questions that concern you. Approach the study of your Profile and Centers carefully, and then you will establish contact with yourself, allowing you to move confidently and decisively in the right direction.</item>
        <item>Humility. This is about behavior where the best way in life is to acknowledge your place in the hierarchy and the rules by which your community operates. Humility allows you to observe what is happening, understand how everything works here, and gradually gain confidence. It\'s like \"knowing your place and doing what needs to be done.\" Wherever and in whatever capacity this year finds you, the first important step is to accept the fact and even reconcile with it. Not necessarily forever. Learn to conduct yourself correctly. You might not like your position and situation, but everything has its meaning; try to accept reality.\n\nAcknowledging who you are and where you are will create opportunities for you and help you navigate the challenges of this year, strengthening your positions. This is because, unlike others, you won\'t expend energy on suffering from \"injustice\". That\'s why it is crucial to understand your personality Type and your one true strategy for action. Dive as deep as you can into your Design: explore all your active Gates and Channels, pay careful attention to your Inner Authority and Strategy to best actualize your inherent potential.</item>
        <item>From the rhetoric of struggle and resistance, the world may transition to actual conflicts and battles. The uniqueness of conflicts this year lies in the fact that fighters find themselves alone with their challenges. The theme of alienation emerges. It\'s remarkable that such a characteristic aligns with a year when many countries hold significant elections for their top leaders. Elections will take place in many countries worldwide. Within these processes, there will be a sense of detachment from the global agenda. Some alliances may break apart, while others may form. The feeling of \"we are left alone\" will periodically arise in different parts of the planet.\n\nThe same can happen on an individual level. Be attentive to recognize whether you are truly in a situation where perseverance and fighting are necessary. And if so, understand that the most challenging situations are faced alone with life. However, assistance can be sought, even if it seems to others that you are managing on your own. Others may not see it clearly. People expect everyone to handle things on their own, but this is just a fantasy.</item>
        <item>If you want to uphold your values and grow, you need to allocate resources wisely and practically. People will expect practical solutions in money management and savings from each other. Many will seek care and support. It\'s challenging to pinpoint how this quality manifests in the world. Perhaps we will witness an influx of refugees in need of care from volunteers and various organizations. Maybe there will be a surge in the activity of different funds and companies involved in investments, effectively managing your money. Or, there might be a boom in scammers promising the world but leaving us with empty pockets. One thing is certain: be attentive in handling your finances, check who you are giving them to, ensure these individuals are honest and competent.\n\nWhen making significant decisions, do not overlook the advice of your Inner Authority, review all your insights and recommendations, and be attentive to the reactions of your body. Others may also expect you to take care of them. Be realistic – if you cannot solve the problems people bring to you, try redirecting the request to those who can. Be honest and competent in dealing with the resources of other people. This includes money, time, attention, and other resources exchanged between people.</item>
        <item>If people inefficiently use resources, the blow this year will hit individuality. You may have to sacrifice your uniqueness and lose money if you cannot be an effective manager for yourself and others. Feelings of melancholy and boredom might arise. If we behave correctly regarding the law of this year, there is a chance to unleash the power of inner strength through earning money and accumulating resources, which naturally benefits those around us. Money and spirituality go hand in hand, which is the lesson of this year. The slogan of this activation could be: \"The more I personally earn, the happier the world becomes.\"\n\nPeople will want to associate only with those who are \"like-minded\" and preferably not for free.\nHowever, if an unpleasant client comes to you, for the sake of preserving your spirit, you may not want to sell them your product or service. Ultimately, honesty and materialism complement each other. Insufficient honesty with oneself and one\'s clients brings more losses than profits from a compromising deal. The most important thing: focus on your prosperity, delve into your Human Design, carefully study your Type, develop your strengths, and work on your weaknesses, be aware of your natural energy, and use your resources effectively.</item>

        <item>There is a chance that new knowledge or ways of organizing the world, both revolutionary and destructive, will be advanced. It\'s unlikely that what is proposed to society this year will take root. This refers to a profound change in humanity\'s beliefs. Even if new trends are not immediately accepted, the process itself will be initiated. Most likely, after some time, we will witness an entirely new world with a new form of organization and a system of values.</item>
        <item>The world is still going through a crisis period, ultimately leading to change. We continue to live \"in the history books.\" This might be a year of significant revelations that either help cope with the crisis or give rise to new ones. If you possess any secrets, guard them until the right moment. People may also disclose secrets willingly or unwittingly. We are eager for change and will seize any opportunity. If you are aware in advance that your company is expecting layoffs or closure, you will start looking for a job sooner and be better prepared. This is just an example.\nTherefore, do not underestimate your environment and information. People may also use information they have to manipulate others for their benefit. Be more attentive. You may not immediately understand which information will become particularly crucial.</item>
        <item>Since the time of COVID-19, humanity continues to live in an era of limited possibilities. In the coming year, the entire world will be focused on extracting maximum opportunities within such constraints. \"Yes, we cannot create world peace, but what is the best we can do at the moment?\" \"Yes, we cannot increase the education budget, but how can we maximize what is possible? Which funding programs can we cut?\" This theme continues the rhetoric, drivers, politics, economics, values, and laws. People will be forced to continue adapting and maximizing.</item>

    <string name="next_year_conclusion_text">As evident from the forecast, our society and the world at large are undergoing significant changes.

It\'s important to stay connected with yourself, regardless of what is happening around you. Therefore, be attentive, listen to your strategy and inner authority, stock up on popcorn, and navigate your way through these interesting and challenging times.</string>
